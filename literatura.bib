  abstract =	"{\textbf{Abstract:} We describe methods for making
		 volume decreasing algorithms more resistant to certain
		 types of errors. Such error recovery techniques are
		 crucial if {DNA} computers ever become practical. Our
		 first approach relies on applying {PCR} at various
		 stages of the computation. We analyze its performance
		 and show that it increases the survival-probability of
		 various strands to acceptable proportions. Our second
		 approach relies on changing the method by which
		 information is encoded on {DNA} strands. This encoding
		 is likely to reduce false negative errors during the
		 bead separation procedure. }",
  annotate =	"Introduces two methods to deal with common sources of
		 errors: \parbox{\linewidth}{ \begin{itemize} \item PCR
		 after each selection step is shown to increase good
		 strands' survival probability (for volume-decreasing
		 algorithms such as Adleman's or Lipton's). \item Double
		 encoding improves the probability that correct strands
		 are extracted. \end{itemize} } Note that
		 \cite{KaplanEA96,Smith} suggest PCR may be a major
		 source of errors itself!"
